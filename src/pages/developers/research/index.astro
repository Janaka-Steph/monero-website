          Monero is not only committed to making a fungible currency, but also to continued research into the realm of
          financial privacy as it involves cryptocurrencies. Below you'll find the work of our very own Monero Research
          Lab, with more papers to come. To contact the Monero Research Lab, please email

            The Monero Research Lab released an annotated version of the cryptonote whitepaper. This is sort of like an
            informal review of the claims that are made line-by-line of the whitepaper. It also explains some of the
            harder concepts in relatively easy to understand terms.

            This paper is a formal review of the original cryptonote paper by MRL researcher Brandon Goodell. He takes
            an in-depth look at the claims and mathematics presented in the cryptonote paper.
